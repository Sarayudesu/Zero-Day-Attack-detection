# Zero-Day-Attack-detection

## Overview

Zero-Day Attack Detection is an advanced security tool designed to identify and mitigate zero-day vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious acttackers. Utilizing cutting-edge AI and machine learning algorithms (Autoecoders and MLP), this project aims to enhance the security of systems by detecting unknown threats.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Identifies zero-day vulnerabilities as they occur.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Leverages AI to improve detection accuracy over time.
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Provides detailed analysis and reporting of detected threats.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing security infrastructure.

## Why This Project is Useful

Zero-day attacks are among the most dangerous threats in the cybersecurity landscape because they exploit unknown vulnerabilities. Traditional security measures often fail to detect these attacks until it is too late. This project provides a proactive approach to security, ensuring that systems are protected against even the most sophisticated threats.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
